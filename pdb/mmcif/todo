* in error testing, make a single function that loops over a table
 { filename, "expected error type"}
 and remove all the individual functions

* add a test that provokes the bad conversion of residue number

* currently, we use a hash with bool's to say if something is there. We should use a struct{} instead.

* if we read the file via mmap, the scanning would be easier.
